### What the idea was:
The idea was to develop a mobile app for Woodlands care home that allows residents to independently choose their daily lunch preferences and select activities for the upcoming week. The app should also enable residents to send voice notes or text messages with activity suggestions to the manager. Staff should be able to log in to update the weekly menu and activity schedule, while residents and staff each have their own separate login interfaces.

### What your solution was: 
Our solution was to design and develop a user-friendly mobile app that catered to the specific needs of Woodlands care home. We created distinct interfaces for residents and staff, each tailored to their roles. Residents can log in, view the day's menu options, select their desired meal, and choose activities for the week. They can also record voice notes or send text messages with activity suggestions. Staff members can log in, access a backend dashboard, and update the week's menu and activity schedule. The app integrates with Google Calendar for seamless event planning.

### 3. Things you overcame:

-Technical Integration: Integrating with Google Calendar posed a challenge due to API integration and ensuring synchronisation between the app and the calendar events.

-Voice Notes Handling: Implementing voice note functionality required tackling audio recording, storage, and potential conversion to text for manager review.

-User Accessibility: Designing an interface that accommodates both elderly residents and staff members with varying technical skills, ensuring usability and accessibility.

### 4. Things you'd do if you had more time:

Given more time, we would focus on further enhancing the app in several ways:

-Enhanced Personalisation: Develop algorithms that learn from residents' choices and tailor activity and meal suggestions accordingly.

-Improved Voice Recognition: Invest more time in refining voice note conversion to text, ensuring accurate transcription.

-Expanded Notification System: Implement a comprehensive notification system that reminds residents of upcoming activities, meal choices, and staff of their administrative tasks.

-Enhanced Design and Layout: Allocate time to design and layout improvements, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that aligns with the preferences of both residents and staff.

-Extended Platform Support: Extend the app to other platforms, such as tablets or web interfaces, to accommodate a broader range of devices.

### In summary, our solution was to develop a user-friendly mobile app that facilitates meal and activity choices for residents, enables staff to manage schedules, and integrates with Google Calendar. We overcame technical challenges related to integration, voice notes, accessibility, and design. If given more time, we would focus on personalisation, voice recognition, notifications, testing, platform expansion, and enhancing the design and layout of both the app and website interfaces.
